            Nigerian yam and eggs recipe made with succulent boiled yam and fried eggs garnished with vegetables and sardines. Yam is highly nutritious, filling and contains less starch than potatoes.
<br>
    Boiled yam and fried eggs is a common breakfast choice in Nigerian homes. Yam is a popular staple in West African countries which means lots of yam are planted annually to meet this demand. According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria accounted for about 70 percent of the world’s production amounting to 17 million tonnes from land area 2,837,000 hectares under yam cultivation. Yams have a distinct brown skin and can be white, yellow, purple, or pink inside depending on the type of yam and maturity.

For me as a kid, boiled yam and fried eggs is a family favourite, we have it as a treat most Sunday mornings. Also, growing up as a kid I used to believe that this combination is meant for the privileged, so there is always a feeling of delight whenever it’s on the menu. These days, there is even more of a feeling of satisfaction whenever I am able to get my hands on a tuber of yam; as living abroad means most of Nigerian staples are imported, hence the are scarce.

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p>How to boil Yam</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Slice yam tuber with a sharp knife. Yam should be sliced from the tip which is usually the softest end.</li>
        <li>Peel yam with a knife. If the yam is cut into round slices, it can easily be peeled by holding a slice on one palm and gently going round while peeling the skin off with a knife on the other hand. This is the best method to peel yam especially if you don’t plan to eat it all at once. Yam can also be peeled by sitting the base on a firm surface pointing upwards, then slicing skin off with a knife in vertical strips. This is the common method used by food vendors as it is faster.</li>
        <li>Place each slice of yam in cold water. This is very important to keep the slices from getting brown and dry.</li>
        <li>Rinse the yam under cold water and toss in a saucepan. Add 400mls of water and season with sugar (optional) and salt to taste. 400mls of water should cook about 800g-1kg of yam, so add more water accordingly.</li>
        <li>Boil for about 20-25mins at high-medium heat. Check halfway to ensure that water hasn’t dried out. Once the yam is cooked, drain out any excess water so the yam doesn’t get too soft and sticky.</li>
        
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Fried Eggs
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Crack 4 eggs in a mixing bowl and garnish with sliced tomatoes, onions and scotch bonnet.</li>
        <li>Add shredded sardines (or corned beef or shrimps), salt and stock cubes and mix together with a fork or whisk. 4 eggs are enough for 1 or 2 serves.</li>
        <li>Place a non-stick frying pan on the hob under medium heat and add 3-4 tablespoons of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up for about 2mins before tossing the egg batter in. I used the sunflower oil from the sardine can, which means I didn’t have to used extra oil.</li>
        <li>Fry for 3-4mins or until golden brown around the edges. Flip and fry for another 2-3mins.</li>
      </ol>
